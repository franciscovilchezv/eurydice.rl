In this project we are trying to solve the automated musical composition problem using Deep Reinforcement Learning. Solving this problem with the usage of Reinforcement Learning becomes an interesting approach since it enables the interaction between the computer and humans for training which compositions sound good and that way improve the computer's compositional skills.

In this project report we will present the results that we have obtained so far by applying \emph{q-learning}. We have been able to teach the computer which notes are the best to be played after other notes according to our criteria, and that way generate a melody that match our preferences. We will present the approach followed, examples on how we tested it, and the future steps that we will take in the project.
