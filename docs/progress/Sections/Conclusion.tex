Based on the progress done so far, we have been able to adapt the musical composition problem to a Reinforcement Learning scenario. We were able to use \emph{q-learning} in order to learn \emph{musical policies} that allow us to know which note should follow a previous sequence of notes. We were able to test how our algorithm learn based on the input provided by the user, and we included an automated test in order to verify that the algorithm was adequately learning the appropriate values for each \emph{(state, action)}. Finally, we detailed the future enhancements that we are planing to include for the future releases of our project with its respective methodology and that way improve the results that we are getting in order to get more pleasant melodies.
