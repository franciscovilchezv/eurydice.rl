We will be solving the automated musical composition problem by applying Deep Reinforcement Learning. Our solution will use Q-learning for moving between states and a Recurrent Neural Network for storing the different notes combinations approximate values. For measuring our results we will evaluate if a composition from our model can be considered pleasant or not, and we will request the opinion from other people. However, for comparing the results with other works, we will use music theory in order to measure how many notes fit in the key and compare it with the performance obtained by previous works.
