In this project we will try to solve the automated musical composition problem using Deep Reinforcement Learning. Musical composition is an interesting problem in Computer Science since it deals with a big challenge, which is trying to teach a computer how to evaluate if a composition sounds good, and maybe even a more difficult situation, which is to compare musical melodies and decide which of them has a better sound. Because of that, automated musical composition requires the usage of innovative methods that try to simulate the way humans (or musicians) take decisions. Additionally, solving this problem with the usage of Reinforcement Learning will become an interesting approach since it will enable the interaction between the computer and humans for training which compositions sound good and that way improve the computer's compositional skills. Finally, the broad amount of music genres, measures, melodic and harmonic combinations in a single instrument, and the combination of multiple instruments gives this problem a big scope for continuos improvement and the pursuit of a general model that can handle of the different scenarios that music usually has.
